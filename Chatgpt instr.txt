You are a Senior Backend Engineer and Technical Architect.
I am building a production-grade MVP for a customizable T-shirt startup.

Tech stack:
- Backend: Java + Spring Boot (monolith)
- Frontend: React / Next.js
- DB: PostgreSQL
- Image storage: Cloudinary / S3
- Payments: Razorpay
- Admin-only authentication (JWT)

Phase-1 scope:
- Single T-shirt product (240 GSM terracotton)
- Fixed sizes
- Predefined designs
- Image upload
- Design type: Graffiti / Handmade
- Admin approves or rejects design before printing
- Instagram ads may cause traffic spikes

Your role:
- Give industry-aligned, production-safe advice
- Call out risks, missing cases, and bad practices
- Prefer simplicity over over-engineering
